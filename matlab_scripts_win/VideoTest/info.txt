This test is written by Diego Lozano. 
It runs a black and white screen in a loop and simultaniously sends out a Bitsi code.
The Bitsi is connected via serial port. The trigger can be picked up from the Bitsi parallel out port.
The signal is on bit 1. This is the 2nd pin on the LPT port.

To run the script, start RUN_screencolortest.m.
The file shows the following line:
    colorseq = repmat([1,2], 1, 100);
The last parameter tells you how many repetitions should be performed.
