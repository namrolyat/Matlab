Use of BasicSoundOutputDemo.m:
Type:
	BasicSoundOutputDemo( [repetitions], ['filename'] );

If you leave out repetition it wil go on forever.
If you leave out a filename, the file 'funk.wav' from de Demos derectory will be used.

Be aware that reqlatencyclass = 1 => 4th parameter.     
pahandle = PsychPortAudio('Open', [], [], 1, freq, nrchannels); in the Open method of PsychPortAudio

If you use 0 as in the demoexample, there will be a lot of background noise.
